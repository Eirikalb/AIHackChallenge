    "I have designed this challenge on my own specifically for AI Hack 2018, a student hackathon at Imperial College London and am therefore doing the ML below simply as a feasibility study for my challenge. There are millions of approaches to the dataset I have chosen to work with, but I found that a simple regression problem would be a nice simple challenge for people that are not as experienced with machine learning, especially given the time pressure of a 24-hour datathon. However,the challenge might be framed in a more open way so more experienced students can look for their own insights and relations\n",

    "This dataset is originated from the US census governments webpages. The data was originially in a Geodatabase format, which is a standard format when working with geographically sensitive data like this dataset. The data gathered describes 23000 block groups in California. A block is described by the US census bureau as \"A census block is the smallest geographic unit used by the United States Census Bureau for tabulation of 100-percent data (data collected from all houses, rather than a sample of houses)\" they usually have a population of around 1000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a result of a 10 question questionaire that every single American citizen has filled out. The answers have then been restructured into 7730 different variables describing the various socioeconomic traits block group in America. We are currently using one subset of the dataset, namely \"X15_EDUCATIONAL_ATTAINMENT\" for predicting the \"PER CAPITA INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2016 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS)\". Just to clarify each block group originally has 7730 variables, but we only use the 350 or so of them that describe the educational attainment just to be able to actually have some sense of what information is going in to our algorithms.
